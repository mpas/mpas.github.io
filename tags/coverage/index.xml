      <description>So assume you are assigned to a JEE/Web project with no written functional requirements, no technical design, no functional and unit tests and even no business process description. Sounds really hopeless, but it is your responsibility to learn the system and make adjustments to it. Does this sound familiar?? Hopefully not :) But every now and then this scenario seems to happen.
One can start to complain :), stop working on the project or even better master the concept of Software Archeology.</description>
